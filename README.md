User Stories:

Single-page, single-user app.

A user sees two random cats - their pictures, their names, and their owners, and a toggle for two different standards (Cuteness and Majesty) to judge them by.

A user selects her preferred cat by clicking on their image. This cat is declared the winner, and the stats of both cats are displayed - how many times it has won by that standard, and the percent of time it wins by that standard. The cats are no longer clickable.

Then two new random cats will appear for judgement.

Ideally, there will be a place for people to view individual cats and their stats (or even rankings tables), as well as a user input form for people to submit their own cats for judgement.

_____________________
Recommended Use:

This concept was introduced to me as a drinking game. Ideally, the cats are displayed on a scren visible to all; the group argues over which cat they think is cuter. A cat is selected and its stats are viewed: one drinks if the cat that was selected was not the popular winner according to its stats. Much shrieking over kittens ensues.

Bugs:

This app is unfinished.

I ran into some trouble when trying to build cat arrays in the Javascript from the backend so I wouldn't have to make as many ajax calls. I still think this is the best solution, but I need a little more time (or help) to figure out how to make it work.

As of now, the winner functions are not complete - it displays the winner, but both are still clickable, and it does not yet display all the stats.
